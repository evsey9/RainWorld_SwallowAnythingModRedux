# RainWorld_SwallowAnythingMod
Lets you swallow anything. Even living creatures! And other slugcats....

To drop creatures and such you now have to either throw them or hold down + pickup (just pressing pickup won't drop them now, hold pickup to swallow)

To piggyback someone, you have to be crouching and holding. Otherwise, you will swallow the other person.

Carnivorous slugcats can swallow corpses by standing and eat corpses by crouching, and the artificer mauls by standing and swallows by crouching.
