# RainWorld_SwallowAnythingMod
Lets you swallow anything. Even living creatures! And other slugcats....
To drop creatures and such you now have to either throw them or hold down + pickup (just pressing pickup won't drop them now, hold pickup to swallow)
To piggyback someone, you have to be crouching and holding. Otherwise, you will swallow the other person.
